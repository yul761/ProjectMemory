# Roadmap (Research Focus)

## Near Term (0-2 months)

- Define core research questions and evaluation protocol.
- Stabilize benchmark fixtures + deterministic seeds.
- Improve digest consistency pass rate with fixed test suites.
- Publish baseline benchmark report with methods section.

## Mid Term (2-4 months)

- Expand benchmark suite with scenario packs and ablations.
- Add retrieval plugin interface for vector backends (optional, BYO).
- Add drift/audit analysis for digest state snapshots.
- Produce a public reproducibility checklist.

## Long Term (4+ months)

- Memory graph primitives (entity + relation extraction as optional pipeline).
- Formalize dataset release and licensing.
- Multi-model evaluation harness (LLM providers, temperature, budgets).
- Ecosystem adapters (Slack/Discord/Notion) as reference integrations.

## Contribution Priorities

If you want to contribute today, start with:
1. Benchmark fixtures and deterministic evaluation.
2. Digest consistency tests and failure analysis.
3. Documentation for research reproducibility.
