# Frontend Options (Out of Scope)

This repo ships **no UI**. Official integrations are adapters and SDKs:
- Telegram adapter (webhook receiver)
- CLI
- SDKs: `@projectmemory/client` and `@projectmemory/react`

Possible future frontends:
- Web app (Next.js) for digests + timelines
- Desktop app (Tauri) for capture and offline drafts
- Mobile app (React Native)
